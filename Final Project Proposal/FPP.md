# Final Project Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

*Barbara's Gallery*

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project is about creating a web-based synthesizer.")

My final project is about creating a photography portfolio website.

## List at least 3 resources you know you will use in developing your project

1. I love the design for the home page:

2. I like how her classified her works:
https://www.lnaylor.com/
3. I like the "message me" part in the "About + Contact":
https://www.ravivora.com/contact

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The outcome should be a clear photography portfolio website. It should at least include 20+ photos that have been divided into different catagories, contact information, and an introduction of myself.  

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

- A website with a lot of photos inside

- Self-introduction

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- Basic web design

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

- Everything before plus...
- Homepage
- Comfortable & beautiful web design
- "message me" part

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

First of all, I will be googling about what are the common features in a photography website, and think about what are the things I'm going to adapt.
Second, use the examples I loved to create a website. I will be using html all the time, including a lot of css file.
