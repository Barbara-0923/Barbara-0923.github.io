# Documentation for the Final Project
## Basic Information
### Website link:
#### https://barbara-0923.github.io/ 
## what you did
#### I basicly made a photograpy portfolio website with four categories with several pictures each+ one introduction&contact information page + one basic home page that includes four pictures from four categories.
## how you did it
#### several htmls + a lot of css files with pictures took by myself
#### brief introduction of myself + self protrait for the contact page
#### AI called "Screenshot to Code"
## the problems you faced
### Codeing in general
#### The example I want to adapt from doesn't show its source, so I use an AI called "Screenshot to Code" for basic coding. It's a website based on ChatGPT 4, which can convey your screenshot into proper codes wwith preview. I took a picture from the example website and put it inside the AI, but it's less accurate than I thought, so after serveral failing attempts, I decided to use the frist version of it and change other things by myself.
### Format
#### It's really difficult to line up the pictures into specific patterns with effective uses of all the space. That will be the stuff I'm going to work on later. 
### Links inside the Link
#### After I finish the coding for all the pages inside the main website, I found it really hard to make them useable. It's working sometime, but most of the time not. Later on I figure out that I forgot to add html for every links, and after I finish that, things are working.
### Uploading Pictures
#### I struggled at first on how to put pictures into the website. Although I know that I need to make css files, I cannot find the links between them. I first label all the pictures I will be using and put them into the same folder of the websites, and after I got the basic coding from AI, I first try to replace AI's link with mine, and it didn't work. Later on, I figure out that they have to be in the exact same name.
## Some thoughts when I'm doing this
### Format
#### I decided to keep the background color/format clean & simple, cause my main focus are the colorful pictures, and I don't want anything to distract people's eyes. 
### Limitations
#### Because I don't have enough time, I decide to limit the amount of categories from seven to four. I think this is actually not a bad move, because this makes my website looks clearer and cleaner.
